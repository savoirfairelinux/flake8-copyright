Flake8 Copyright plugin
=======================

Checks for copyright notices in all python files. It runs a simple regular expression search for
strings like::

    Copyright 2014 <author>
    Copyright (C) 2014 <author>

``<author>`` can be anything unless you specify it with the ``copyright-author`` option (see below).

Install
-------

Install with pip::

    pip install flake8-copyright


Further options
---------------

copyright-min-file-size
    Minimum number of characters in a file before requiring a copyright notice. This is to avoid
    forcing yourself to add copyright notices to very small or empty files. Default: ``3``.

copyright-author
    Checks for a specific author in the copyright notice.

copyright-regexp
    If you're not happy with the regexp that is ran to look for copyright notices, you can change it
    with this option. Default: ``Copyright\s+(\(C\)\s+)?\d{4}([-,]\d{4})*\s+%(author)s``. ``%(author)s`` is
    replaced by the contents of ``copyright-author``.
